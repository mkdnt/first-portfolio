      <h2 class="center"> hello! </h2>
      <p>My name is Mike, and I'm a software developer living in Washington, DC.</p>
      <p>I have worked in education both in the US and internationally. I am thrilled to begin the next part of my life in coding.</p>

      <h3> about me </h3>
      <p> I graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in English (Creative Writing), then moved to Seoul, South Korea, to teach English and earn a master's degree in International Studies from Korea University.</p>
      <p>I am excited to continue learning about software development with Thinkful. Writing code with <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong> allows me to have fun with language, teamwork, problem-solving, and creative design. </p>
      <p>Outside of my professional life, my personal passion is running. I have run dozens of marathons and half-marathons around the world. My three favorite marathons are:</p>

      <!-- ordered list for races -->

        <li>Austin Marathon 2019</li>
        <li>Montreal Half-Marathon 2015</li>
        <li>Seoul Marathon 2010</li>
      </ol>
